What is Git?
git is an open source vcs that allows the user to keep track 
of all the changes that have been made to the source code of the software.
(also called vcs- version control system) Global information tracker (Git) 
introduced in 2005
vcs examples :- code commit, git, mercurial
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. 
It is a free and open-source version control system used
to handle small to very large projects efficiently.
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling
multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

why we need git ?
One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities.
Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap
and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular
with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment
for every change to your codebase.
features of git 
1 system compatibility 2. collaboration 3.speed 4.distributed system 5.relibility 6. security
git lifecycle assign working directory, initilization, staging, commit in local system, push to github.

Installing Git
Debian/Ubuntu
For the latest stable version for your release of Debian/Ubuntu

# apt-get install git
For Ubuntu, this PPA provides the latest stable upstream Git version

# add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa # apt update; apt install git
===========================================================================
diff between working dir and local repo
The contents of your project folder (the folders and files you find within it) are represented by the working directory.

The working directory is sort of like a workbench, it's where you work on your files (you edit them, you add new files, you delete files etc.).

On the other hand, the .git folder (which is a hidden folder) represents the repository.

Within the .git folder there are two "places" that should be mentioned, the staging area 
(represented by the index file) and the commit history (represented by the objects folder).

The staging area is sort of like a rough draft space. Whenever you are done working on a file
(or files) in your working directory, you want to copy them to the staging area (using the git add command).

Once you have all the files that you want to update in the next version of your project in the
staging area, you are ready to save them in the next version of your project which is called a commit. You do this using the git commit command.

A commit is basically a version of your project and each commit has a 40 character hash
(40 letters and numbers) and this hash acts like a name for the commit, it's a way to refer to it.
==============================================================================================
git pull tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. It is context sensitive,
so all pulled commits will be merged into your currently active branch. git pull automatically
merges the commits without letting you review them first. If you don’t carefully
manage your branches, you may run into frequent conflicts.

git fetch gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch
and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current branch.
This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on 
something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your current branch, you must use git merge afterwards.

""GIT FETCH TELLS LOCAL REPOSITORY ABOUT CHENGES MADE IN REMOTE REPOSITORY IF WE WANT TO SAVE THE CHENGES THEN 
WE NEED TO DO <git merge origin/master> it will update whatever changes made in remote to local repo.""
We can see that with the help of just git pull command we directly fetched and merged our remote repository with the local repository.
git pull = git fetch + git merge

          Git Fetch                                                                     Git Pull
1. Gives the information of a new change from a                        1. Brings the copy of all the changes from a remote repository 
   remote repository without merging into the                             and merges them into the current branch
   current branch.
2. Repository data is updated in the .git directory                     2. The local repository is updated directly
3.  Review of commits and changes can be done                           3. Updates the changes to the local repository immediately.
4.  No possibility of merge conflicts.                                  4.  Merge conflicts are possible if the remote and the local 
                                                                            repositories have done changes at the same place.

git clone is used for just downloading exactly what is currently working on the remote server repository 
and saving it in your machine's folder where that project is placed. Mostly it is used only when we are going
to upload the project for the first time. After that pull is the better option.

git pull is a (clone(download) + merge) operation and mostly used when you are working as teamwork. 
In other words, when you want the recent changes in that project, you can pull.


====================================================================================================


git init >it will initiate empty git repo to that particular dir or folder
.git dir will made 
git status > information about branch how many commits you made how many tracked or untracked files are done 
git status commnd should be run inside the initilised folder only
git checkout -b dev it will create new branch dev
git checkout -b master it will switched to master branch 
branch :- A branch represents an independent line of development.
Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory,
staging area, and project history.
git branch - it shows the currant branch where we are working 
git branch <branch name> it will create new branch
git branch -d <branch name> it will delete particular branch
rename branch
step1 switch out to particular branch which we want to rename
git checkout feature1
git branch -m featureA this will rename branch feature1 to featureA
=======================================================================
Merging
The git merge allows a user to merge different branches into one.
it will create a new commit on merging.
history of commits are not transferred.

for merge one branch to other we need to switch to reciveing branch
where we want our merge 
first we need to checkout to master then
git merge feature-A
========================================================================
git merge conflicts
two peoples pulls same code and work or change same file and merge to main then conflicts create
lets see how to resolve that
git mergetool -t vimdiff this will open vim editor and let us decide to choose the correct code and save them to avoid conflicts
==========================================================================
Git rebase
git rebase allow us to shift set of commits and add as new base
git rebase is same as git merge but it also bring history of commits to the current branch
=========================================================================
git branching strategy
master---hotfix---relase---dev---fetures standard branching
